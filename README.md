datalab-examples
===================

This repository contains example [Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/) Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks for genomics use cases upon public data such as the [Illumina Platinum Genomes](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/discover_public_data/platinum_genomes.html) and [1,000 Genomes](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/discover_public_data/1000_genomes.html).

You can read them here on github:
* [Exploring Genomic Data](https://github.com/googledatalab/notebooks/blob/master/samples/Exploring%20Genomics%20Data.ipynb)
* [Explore the 1000 Genomes Sample Information](datalab/genomics/Explore%201000%20Genomes%20Samples.ipynb)
* [Genome-wide association study](datalab/genomics/Genome-wide%20association%20study%20(GWAS).ipynb)
* [Getting started with the Google Genomics API](datalab/genomics/Getting%20started%20with%20the%20Genomics%20API.ipynb)

To run them yourself and discover other sample notebooks, see the [Google Genomics Cookbook](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/run_familiar_tools/datalab.html).
